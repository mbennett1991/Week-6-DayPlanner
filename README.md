# Week-6-DayPlanner
### Description
In this project, I used JQuery and Moment.Js to create an interactive Workday Day Planner. In the day planner, it will show you what hour you are currently working in. You can add in to dos for the day that will be saved to your personal local storage, to help stay organized. In this project I learned more about JQuery, utilizing <b>this</b> object keyword, as well as utilizing parent and sibling elements within the DOM!
